EXERCISE THREE: Looping With Objects! 

[1] Note the structure of the imported pizzaPlaces object. Instead of having objects in an array, we have objects in objects! This means we cannot easily use the Array methods you are used to. In order to work with this data structure, we will practice accessing keys on objects and looping through the key-value pairs in an object!
