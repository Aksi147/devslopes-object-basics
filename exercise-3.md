EXERCISE THREE: Looping With Objects!

NOTE: Be sure to use your built-in object methods and the for... in loops we covered in the curriculum videos. 

[1] Note the structure of the imported pizzaPlaces object. Instead of having objects in an array, we have objects in objects! This means we cannot easily use the Array methods you are used to. In order to work with this data structure, we will practice accessing keys on objects and looping through the key-value pairs in an object!

[2] Write a function, getFavoritePlaces, that takes in a pizzaPlaces object and returns an array of names for all the favorited pizza places.

[3] Write a function, cheapestTopping, that takes in a pizzaPlaces object and a topping. The function should return the pizzaPlace object that offers that topping at the lowest price. If no pizza place offers that topping, return "No pizza places found."

[4] Write a function, calculateAverageRating, that intakes a pizzaPlaces object and returns the average number of stars of all pizza places. 

[5] Write a function, getMostCommonCuisine, that intakes a pizza places object and returns the most frequently listed cuisine.
